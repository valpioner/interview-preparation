https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY5SeCl_8NE&feature=youtu.be

Preparation:

- find exact salary you want, know the market range
- what value you provide for a company
- go higher first with your salary expectation
- don't end conversation
- give reason for everything
- always negotiate
- be positive
- let they understand you may have multiple offers
- always say `thank them` to reiterate your interest in the position, every round say how much it goes a long way to closing a gap and how I am excited to work here. show excitement
- always keep your frame, I want to be here and here is what I am worth
- prepare your Aces
  - I consider myself as a top of the niche developer, I can bring more value (faster, smarted, more experienced, have more knowledge in actual and around areas etc.)
  - I may have several offers and I got a bit higher proposals
  - Consider myself as an investment, you don't simply loose on salary for me, you also get higher ROI.
  - I have the exact unique experience you are looking for in a candidate (if that is true)
  - Ask for other flexible compensation variants like options, stocks, annual or other bonuses
  - Ask for salary review periods, if it can happen sooner for you
  - Frame in terms of their benefits, not only your own `based on my success in my last companies that I want to bring to this company..`, `think of my as an investment...`
  - `Would it be appropriate to discuss ...`, `Understanding you may be constrained from budgetary reasons...`, `I appreciate...`, give them some power to fight back to bring back some flexibility
  - `Wouldn't it make sense to revaluate in 6 month my...`
  - `I would like to be here, also I would like to bring my best for to whatever company I go for, and I also want my value to be fairly be represented by my compensation`

What salary do you want?

- I know that an average developer in a `market` makes around `$1000`, so considering myself as a top of the niche (`because...`), I would expect `$1200 (a higher range of a spectrum)` is a proper sum that I deserve.

We may offer you `higher than we offered, but lower than you asked for` / year, are you in?

- Thank you for you offer, it sounds very generous and I am very excited potentially working in your company, however that is an important decision for me and I plan to work in a company for many years, so I need to take some time to think over it and discuss with my wife to make sure we are both comfortable in.

(Tell that I would like to work for them, but I need time to get response from other companies I interviewed in to be sure to get most appropriate offer, ask for time. If you are waiting for response, tell them in some time, that you already received an offer from other companies, build a sense of urgency, you have a deadline when you have to decide and response yes/no.)
