## Time complexity

- Excellent 🟩
  - `O(1)`        - constant (no loops, assignment)
  - `O(log n)`    - logarithmic (usually searching algorithms have log n if they are sorted (Binary Tree Search)) Divide & Conquer
- Fair 🟨
  - `O(n)`        - linear (single loop of n items)
- Bad 🟧
  - `O(n log n)`  - log linear (usually sorting operations)
- Horrible 🟥
  - `O(n^2)` 🐌     - quadratic (2 nested loops, comparing with each element in array)
  - `O(2^n)` 🐌🐌     - exponential (recursive algorithms that solves a problem of size N)
  - `O(n!)`  🐌🐌🐌     - factorial (nested loop for every element)

## Rules - how to calculate f() complexity

- Rule 1: Worst Case
- Rule 2: Remove Constants
- Rule 3: Different terms for inputs (a+b) (a*b)  (next operation: +, nested operation:*)
- Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants

## What causes TIME complexity

- operations (+, -, *, /)
- comparisons (<, >, ==)
- looping (for, while)
- outside function call (function())

## What causes SPACE complexity

- variables
- data structures
- function call
- allocations
