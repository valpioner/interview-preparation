## Recommendations

### DO

- Prepare well (otherwise, next recommendations won't make any sense)
- Be confident
- Be nice, positive and smile, show that you are team-player, so they would love to work with you
- Be active and communicative
- Show your interest (in company, tech and programming)
- Make nice first and last impression (first few minutes of the interview set a tone, determines how to treat you from a non-tech perspective, shows your soft-skills, first & last impression is what interviewer will remember most, finish interview strong, sell yourself.)
- Treat interviews as an additional experience, life is not over even if you fail
- Ask related questions, but not too many
- Watch your posture
- Have a win & conquer attitude
- Think of yourself that you are the best candidate and act so!
- Reply with an email with a research of a problem you couldn't resolve on interview, show you took a time for research (outstand, make them remember you).
- Prepare 4 heroes stories: Technical, Successful, Leadership, Challenge
- Try to think of yourself as an actual interviewer and you explain a solution for the problem to the interviewee
- Act normal
- Do the research (about company, market, salaries)

### DON'T

- Don't be nervous and scared (interviewer may treat it as un-confidence and lack of experience)
- Don't be a dick
- Don't be negative
- Don't lie
- Don't be a smart ass, if you know smth better, have a parent/son attitude
- Don't show your ego

## Non-technical questions

Tell me about yourself? (1 min to pitch, stand out)

- tell the heroe's journey, your life success story, stand out, why you are better
- mention things you want to get asked
- skills should be relevant to job

Why do you want to work with us? (stand out)

- show why they are top choice, make them feel special.
  Example: I have researched your company for a while, I did a work similar to this in a past. I think I can add value and learn smth new, so I can become better with you

Why did you leave your last job?

- no negativity, be as positive as you can
- I want to grow, new domain, new challenges, new success, official end of last project

Tell me about a problem you solved (interesting project you worked on)?

- prepare a problem that you solved (situation --> action --> result)
- have metrics and numbers
- scaling, performance, security, other quality attributes (how I improved it)
- technologies should relate

What is your biggest weakness?

- real answer
- show how you improved it
  Example: start coding before thinking on solution, so lately I do sudo-code with comments before real coding

What is my biggest strength?

- I am a nice, positive person with no ego, team player, never complain but work towards win/win solution
- I am an experienced developer
- My priority is to make client happy, I understand both business & development
- I can explain pure tech stuff in easy language, so managers will understand my point
- I work not only for money, I am interested to resolve a problem and provide good solution

What to ask the interviewer? (stand out)

- focus on interviewer (YOU)
- mention smth interviewer mentioned, ask for extra details, show interest
- ask about the role / tech stack, potential team, about company, any conflicts, remote word, what they focus on, what are the main problems they face, what they are looking for in the potential candidate.
  Example: Why did you personally join this company, how do you feel here, where company is going to be in next 5 years, do you plan to stay here for next 5 years?
  What they wish they were told when they joined the company?
