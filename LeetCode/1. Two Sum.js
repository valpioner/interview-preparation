  ðŸŸ¢ 1. Two Sum ðŸ‘½ ðŸ¥¶
  https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

  Description by google:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw

  Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

  Example:

  Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

  Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
  return [0, 1].

/* My description:

  - worst approach -  with 2 nested loops - O(a*b)
  - still bad approach - binary search inside 1 loop - O(n log n)
  - good approach - check sum of first & last and move towards the center (first to end then last to beginning) - O(n) - if input is sorted, if not we can sort first but then it will be O(n log n), same as binary search approach
  - if input is unsorted - iterate 1 loop and save complement number (n - current) in separate array and find if current === complement from that array. Using Hashtable. - O(n)
