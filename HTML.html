id vs class

Why use semantic html vs div

<script> - use when it is small and is relied upon by an async script. Place above async script that relies on it.
  HTML file will be parsed until the script file is hit, at that point parsing will stop and a request will
  be made to fetch the file (if itâ€™s external). The script will then be executed before parsing is resumed.

<script async> - use when script doesn't rely on other scripts
  downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it when it has finished downloading.

<script defer> - use when script relies on other scripts
  downloads the file during HTML parsing and will only execute it after the parser has completed. defer scripts are
  also guaranteed to execute in the order that they appear in the document.

Where to include <link> and <script> and why?
